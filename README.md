## Pre-generate ElevenLabs Audio

Before deploying, generate these 6 clips in ElevenLabs Voice Design and save to `/public/audio/`:

| File | Script |
|------|--------|
| `intro.mp3` | "Welcome. You have come far to sit in this chair. Ten questions stand between you and everything. The question is — are you wise enough... or are you out?" |
| `correct-low.mp3` | "Correct! You're on your way." |
| `correct-high.mp3` | "Extraordinary. Very few make it this far." |
| `wrong.mp3` | "And that... is where your journey ends. So close, yet so far." |
| `checkpoint.mp3` | "You have secured this amount. It is yours, no matter what happens next." |
| `victory.mp3` | "Unbelievable. You have done what almost no one does. You are wise. You are not out." |

Voice settings: Deep baritone, slow cadence, dramatic pauses, high stability.

## Architecture

All screens are managed via `GameContext` state — no page routing. 
The `GameRouter` in `page.tsx` switches components based on `state.screen`.

```
landing → category → intro → game → gameover / victory → leaderboard
```
